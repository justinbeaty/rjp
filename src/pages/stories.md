## Stories

As many of you may know, we had a fire in our home and lost many photos and documents. As we come across awards and other remembrances of Bobâ€™s life and career we will add them to this living tribute of a life well lived. If you have any pictures or stories please send them to sandy.potter@att.net or justin.beaty@gmail.com and we will gladly add them to the website.

In memory of Bob, whose spirit soared high,\
He aimed for the heavens and reached for the sky.

With might and determination, he always prevailed.\
While flying and gliding, his courage never failed,

In silent flight, like an eagle he'd glide,\
His adventurous heart forever opened wide.

Bob lived life's journey with courage and grace,\
And embraced every challenge he ever did face.

His kindness, a beacon in the darkest of nights,\
Illuminating the path and shining so bright.

His friendship, a shelter to weather the storm,\
His love to embrace us, and keep our hearts warm.

As we gather together and say our goodbyes,\
We remember our friend who flew high in the sky.

His unwavering support, where we found our grace,\
Forever in our hearts, holding a special place.
