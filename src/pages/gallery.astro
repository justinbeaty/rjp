    <h2>Pictures</h2>

    <p>As many of you may know, we had a fire in our home and lost many photos and documents. As we come across awards and other remembrances of Bobâ€™s life and career we will add them to this living tribute of a life well lived. If you have any of your own pictures please send them to sandy.potter@att.net or justin.beaty@gmail.com and we will gladly add them to the website.</p>

    <div style="margin-top: 30px" id="gallery">
        {images.map(image => (

            <a href={image.default.src}
               data-pswp-width={image.default.width}
               data-pswp-height={image.default.height}
               target="_blank">
                <Image height="200" src={image.default} alt="" />
            </a>

        ))}
