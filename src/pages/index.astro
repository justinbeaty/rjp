            <h2>Pictures:</h2>

            <p>As many of you may know, we had a fire in our home and lost many photos and documents. As we come across awards and other remembrances of Bobâ€™s life and career we will add them to this living tribute of a life well lived. If you have any of your own pictures we will gladly add them to the website. You can send those items using the contact information below.</p>
